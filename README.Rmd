# The project is organized as follows:

Root

|--- data\
|----------- DHW_raw_stats_table.csv: raw DHW data set\
\
|--- output\
|----------- Figures and tables produced by the "Interpretation*.R" scripts shown below\
\
|--- RData: Model output in RData format (folder created with 'Code_models.R'):\
|----------- model_count_lat: latitude effect on DHW interval\
|----------- model_count2_lat: latitude effect on DHW duration\
|----------- model_count3_lat: latitude effect on intensity\
|----------- model_count: time and region effects on DHW interval\
|----------- model_count2: time and region effects on DHW duration\
|----------- model_count3: time and region effects on intensity\
\
|--- RScript\
|----------- packages.R: required packages \
|----------- Code_models.R: building and fitting models to data \
|----------- Interpretation_lat.R: Interpretation of models with latitude \
|----------- Interpretation_time_Reg.R: Interpretation of models with time and region \
